    <p class="bio-text">Hello, my name is Junaid. I am an enthusiastic UI/UX designer who not not only brings expertise but creativity to their work. I have created a few projects that showcase my skills as UI/UX designer. I have a keen eye to identify problems and solve them with my problem solving ability. </p>
    <p class="bio-text">In my most recent project, I designed an app which allows users to order food online which depicts my skills such as Visual designing, wireframing and prototyping.</p>
    <p class="bio-text">As my current project, I am working on a case study about a "healthcare practitioner app". An app that will allow users to appoint their schedule through it. During my user research, I found out that a group of users struggle to make an appointment over the call and end up waiting for hours which can be prevented if booked online through our app.</p>
    <p class="bio-text">Adding to that, I'd also like to bring to your notice that I am currently enrolled in a UX Design Program by Google to enhance my skills and grow as a UI/UX designer.</p>
